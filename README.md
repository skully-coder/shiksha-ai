# Shiksha AI: AI-Powered Teaching Assistant

## What is the idea about?

Shiksha AI is an intelligent teaching assistant for educators in low-resource environments. It's a toolkit to empower teachers by automating daily tasks like lesson planning and creating custom materials, accessible via a simple, intuitive interface.

## What problem this tries to solve?

Teachers in developing regions are often overburdened and lack resources. Shiksha AI tackles time constraints, resource scarcity, linguistic diversity, and the need for differentiated learning by providing instant, AI-powered educational tools.

## Tech Stack being used

Built on a modern stack: Next.js/React for the frontend, ShadCN UI & Tailwind CSS for styling, and Firebase for backend services. Genkit, integrated with Google's Gemini models, powers all AI-driven features for a robust and scalable solution.

## Impact of the solution

Shiksha AI boosts teacher efficiency by automating tasks, allowing more student focus. It improves educational quality with accessible, relevant content, enables personalized learning, and helps bridge the digital divide for educators in low-connectivity areas.

## 🧪 Admin Console (Development Mode)

Shiksha AI includes an internal Admin Console to help developers add and manage test users during development — without going through the standard authentication process. This is useful for testing features quickly and reliably.

### How to Use

1. Run the app in development mode:

```
npm run dev
```

2. Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000/admin
```

This route is available only in development mode and may be protected or hidden in production builds.

Features Supported :
- Add new generated users manually
- Bypass the authentication flow for testing
- Assign user roles (e.g., student, teacher, admin)
- Simulate various access levels

⚠️ Warning : 

Do not enable or expose the Admin Console in production environments.
Ensure that the route is disabled, protected, or removed before deploying publicly.
