## 🤝 Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful and empathetic toward others
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Providing constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing for mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of **unacceptable behavior** include:

## 🧑‍💻 Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate corrective action in response to any unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:
- Comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.

Please note that an issue would be considered stale if there is no activity on it for seven days. This is done to encourage other developers who have ideas for the same issue who did not have a chance to contribute originally. The same also goes for PRs with more than three days of inactivity.

- GitHub repositories
- Discussions and issue comments
